## Goals

- [x] Update the INF file to match the NdisProt example
      Not an exact match because we want to avoid the use of co-installers
- [x] Update note in `once-arc` on why it's Acquire/Release ordering
    is because it needs the latest recent `Arc` otherwise we might be accessing an uninitialized `Arc` 
    
    turns out we already kinda did it
- [x] Remove the filler line as clippy has a config for searching more upwards (`accept-comment-above-statement`)
      requires a toolchain bump
      well it doesn't because we already bumped past the minimum required toolchain

Using the actual NdisProt INF meant that we also figured out the destruction order since we could unload again.

## What are the next steps?

- [ ] Port [`prottest.c`](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/d9acf794c92ba2fb0525f6c794ef394709035ac3/network/ndis/ndisprot/6x/test/prottest.c)  to Rust
      would need to be a workspace member of the top-level space
- [ ] Flesh out `bind_adapter` & `unbind_adapter`
      most relevant since they get immediately called once attached to an adapter & the service is started
