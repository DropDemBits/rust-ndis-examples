## Goals

- [x] No more `wrapper.c` files
      Also means that we don't need `cc` anymore

## What are the next steps?

- [ ] Do we really need `KMDF_VERSION_MINOR` and `KMDF_MINIMUM_VERSION_REQUIRED` anymore?
      They're pretty much just used in the logic for choosing the minimum KMDF minor version,
      and choosing the maximum KMDF minor version just comes down to choosing the right `wdfldr` and `wdfdriverentry` lib files.
      We could then, if we wanted the minimum version to be configurable via crate metadata
- [ ] Can we move `wdf_kmdf::raw` to `wdf_kmdf_sys`?
      I think it's there because we reference some of the `wdf_kmdf` types, but could either move those also to `wdf_kmdf_sys`, or just reference the original types (which is the preferred method, at least right now).
